### Hi there 👋

- 🏢 **Quant/Quant Dev/Researcher** | Trading, Research & Execution in TradFi-DeFi 
- 💫 **PhD** | [Mathematical Finance] | Paris Sorbonne, France
- 📸 **Documentary Photographer**

I am a T-Shaped problem solver, Quantitative Researcher/Trader with 15+ years of experience designing and deploying systematic
strategies across crypto, spot and derivatives. Specialized in market microstructure modeling, low-latency execution
(sub-100µs), and alpha signal development using statistical and machine learning methods.

Currently advancing **CLOB for Perps**, **MEV**-aware execution frameworks, including **cross-chain atomicity** and PBS **relay coordination**.

Also messing around with LLMs, MCPs, TEEs and regularly vibe coding with my often-gibberish friends Jules and Claude (mostly in Rust now which I find exquisite).
